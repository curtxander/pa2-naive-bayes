        "Now that you are familiar with `Jupyter Notebooks` and have had some experience working with text data, it's time to begin investigating some real `Natural Language Processing` (`NLP`) tasks, specifically those requiring text classification.\n",
        "Text classification tasks come up in a huge range of contexts; quite often we may be provided with text data in some form and be interested in labeling or categorizing it in some way.\n",
        "In this assignment, you will be working on classifying messages for disaster aid using a `Naive Bayes` (`NB`) classifier, which we have covered in the course videos this week.\n",
        "In the next assignment, you will be asked to perform the same task using a `Logistic Regression` (`LR`) classifier.\n",
        "Victims of natural disasters have urgent needs for food, water, shelter, medicine, and other forms of aid.\n",
        "These needs are often communicated through text messages, social media posts, and local newspapers. Because of their\n",
        "ability to automatically process large amounts of text, `NLP` techniques can play an important role in ensuring that people receive potentially life-saving aid.\n",
        "Our goal will be to perform text classification on messages sent in the aftermath of natural disasters.\n",
        "After you are done testing your `NB` classifier on the disaster aid classification task, you will adapt it to another classification task: labelling the sentiment of messages related to `COVID` as positive or negative.\n",
        "\n",
        "We will be utilizing a `Python` module called `NumPy` in this and the next assignment.\n",
        "We are providing you with a `NumPy` tutorial (`numpy_tutorial.ipynb`) along with this assignment, which you can find in the same repository as this notebook.\n",
        "You can use the provided tutorial to learn `NumPy` for the first time or just refresh your knowledge.\n",
        "\n",
        "**You are encouraged to work with a partner!** We want the assignments in `CS 124` to bring you joy.\n",
        "One way to ensure this is to work with a partner!\n",
        "You are free to work with one other partner in our assignments.\n",
        "If you choose to work with a partner, we ask that each partner work on each part of the assignment in jointly instead of splitting parts.\n",
        "The partnership decision is independent for each assignment, so you can choose to work alone, work with the same partner or work with a different partner in the future assignments, which is a good way to meet your fellow classmates!"

You need to either store the intermediate variables necessary to calculate these or these calculations while training. In training you are *implementing* a Bayes Classifier which you'll *apply* or *use* in classification.

This is a unigram application that may give you an idea of which words were key aid indicators as a sanity check in later cells.
